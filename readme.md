# Introduction

This repository contains four R scripts used to generate plots from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 
This analysis uses "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which is available below.

**Dataset**: [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20MB]

**Description**: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

# Loading the data
To run the R scripts, be sure to place the .txt data set in your working directory. 

# Required packages
In order to run the scripts, you will need to install the [Lubridate package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) from CRAN.
